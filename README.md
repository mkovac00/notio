# Notio

A personal project designed and coded fully and solely by me.  
Notio is a Web Application created with **ReactJS**, using **TypeScript** and **Sass**.

# Description

### What is Notio

Notio provides notes writing and saving functionality combined with a beautiful modern UI.  
It's a really simple application, with plans to add more features in the future.

### Technologies used

**Motivation** behind creating Notio was further improving my UI designing skills combined together with my ReactJS knowledge.  
For this application I decided to use TypeScript to get the feel of working with a strongly typed programming language used in most React applications today. To go with TypeScript I also decided to use Sass to help make cleaner, more reusable and easily readable code for the styling part of the application.

For designing the application, I used Figma. I tried out a few different designs until I decided on the current one which I implemented.

### Challenges I faced

**The biggest challenge** I faced making this application was implementing "dark mode" for the whole application. It took some thinking on how was I going to accomplish this, but it didn't end up being too big of a hassle after deciding on using the React useContext hook which made implementing dark mode a much easier task.

This is my first project where I tried implementing smooth and clean **animations** throughout the whole application, which was a great learning experience, but also an extremely fun and exciting thing to do.

It was also my first time using **Vite** instead of CreateReactApp and I found it to be a much better and noticeably faster experience which I plan on using on in the future as well.

1 -> Go to Notio github page - [Notio GitHub](https://github.com/mkovac00/notio)  
2 -> Click on the "Code" button and copy the command for cloning a repository  
3 -> Open a terminal application on your PC and position yourself to where you want to clone the repository to  
4 -> Paste the command for cloning the repository (ex. **git clone https://github.com/mkovac00/notio.git**)  
5 -> Run **npm run dev** inside that directory to start up the application locally  
6 -> Open _localhost:5173_ inside your browser (or any other url that you get as an output of the npm run dev command)  
Viola! You're all set up!
